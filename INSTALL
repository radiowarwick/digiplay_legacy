Digiplay Component Suite
-----------------------------------

This document provides a guide as to the installation of components in this
package. Detailed installation instructions are now provided in dpsmanual.pdf.

Configuration
-------------
Configuration for this software is stored in /etc/digiplay.conf. A sample config
file is included called digiplay.conf. This should be copied to /etc and adjusted appropriately.

Database Configuration
----------------------
1. Install postgresql database server and configure pg_hba.conf.
2. Install tedia2sql
3. Ensure /etc/tedia2sqlrc is edited so dropStatements = false
4. From the digiplay root directory do:
	make database
	cd share/dps/db
	./dpsinstall (as root or su postgres)

Previous Database Configuration (bit crap and no longer applicable!)
-------------------------------
1. Install postgresql database server and configure pg_hba.conf.
	you need to allow access (using psql for instance) from wherever you
	will run the digiplay software.
2. From digiplay root directory do as root:
		psql template1
3. Then enter: \i db/digiplay.sql
	this will generate the admin and digiuser database accounts, and create
	the digiplay database, tables, sequences and constraints.
4. Then enter: \i db/data.sql
	this will enter necessary data in the database which is needed.
5. Exit psql, and run: db/permissions
	this sets up the default permission on the database for digiplay_user.

Note: You may need to configure /etc/postgresql/pg_hba.conf if you try to
connect to the database from another machine.

Compilation of Code
-------------------
This software requires the following software to be installed. Under debian
this can be achieved by running apt-get install <package-list> where
<package-list> is:
    cmake
    cmake-curses-gui (optional)
	libpqxx-dev
	libreadline-dev
	libncurses-dev
	libqt4-dev
	libldap2-dev
	libcdparanoia0 (for playin application)
	libflac++-dev (for flac audio encoding)
    libmpg123-dev (for MP3 audio encoding)
    libasound-dev (for ALSA support)
    libjack-dev (for JACK support)
This will implicitly install the actual libraries as well. Other distributions
and/or package management systems may require manual installation of these
libraries.

To generate code documentation:
	doxygen

In the top of the code tree create a build sub-directory in which to build
digiplay. For the default options run (from the 'build' directory):
    cmake ../
    make install
The generated libraries and applications will be installed in a 'dist'
subdirectory.

To customise the build and select the installation directory it is recommended
to use the ncurses interface to cmake:
    ccmake ../

Select the desired components to build. All applications are selected by
default, but only basic audio formats are enabled. Select additional formats as
desired. Press 'c' to configure the build. Missing -dev packages and libraries
will be identified at this stage. When configuration completes successfully,
press 'g' to write out the Makefiles.

Now run 'make'.


Website Installation (In Progress)
----------------------------------

For the Web Import you will need the following packages
Under debian this can be achieved by running apt-get install <package-list> where
<package-list> is:
    perl
	libdbi-perl
    libdbd-pg-perl
