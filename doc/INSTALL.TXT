RaW Digital Playout Component Suite
-----------------------------------

This document provides a guide as to the components in this package.

Configuration
-------------
Configuration for this software is stored in /etc/digiplay. A sample config
file is included called digiplay.conf. This should be copied to /etc and named
'digiplay'.

Database Configuration
----------------------
1. Install postgresql database server
2. From digiplay root directory do as root:
		psql template1
3. Then enter: \i db/digiplay.sql
	this will generate the admin and digiuser database accounts, and create
	the digiplay database, tables, sequences and constraints.
4. Then enter: \i db/data.sql
	this will enter necessary data in the database which is needed.
5. Exit psql, and run: db/permissions
	this sets up the default permission on the database for digiplay_user.

Note: You may need to configure /etc/postgresql/pg_hba.conf if you try to
connect to the database from another machine.
